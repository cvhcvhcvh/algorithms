1. Objects

When you don't need any ordering, objects are an excellent choice.

Insertion: O(1)
Removal: O(1)
Access: O(1)
Searching: O(n)

2. Arrays

Arrays are ordered lists

Use arrays when: 
1. you need order 
2. you need fast access/insertion/removal 
  a. insertion/removing at end (push, pop) => O(1)
  b. insertion/removing at beginning (unshift, shift) => O(n)
  c. forEach, map, filter, reduce, etc. => O(n)
